# Boundary-Detection

# Objective:
# The goal of this project is to develop a generalized algorithm to detect the boundaries of any identity card like object.

# Additional Information

Pytorch Version: 1.7.1 CUDA 11.2

# Installation

=> Install Dependencies
=> Training the neural netwrok model
=> Test the train model

# Note: Please execute main.py file

Steps to be followed to Execute.

# Step 1:
Go to main.py file which is in root directory

# Step 2:
Go on running the cells in the mentioned order.

# Step 3:
Input an image and you will get the desired output with boundarys detected.( An out.jpg file will be generated where the output will be there afer you input an image and running it.)

# Note:
There is a folder named "Output Images" where some of the output images are placed. Do refer them for better understanding.
